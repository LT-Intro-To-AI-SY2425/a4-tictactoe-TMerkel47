# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Nothing specific was super difficult especially with help from people around me and Mr. Berg. But the hardest part across the whole assignment was just understanding what code to use and where could get a littl econfusing sometimes.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You could write code that uses what the board and the position of the pieces to determine what the best place to play would be.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would go through the board and determine the position of every X, O, and clear space on the board. I would use a series of if statements and constraints to determine the best position to place the next piece would be.
